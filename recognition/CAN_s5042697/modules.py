"""
Model components for 2D prostate segmentation on HipMRI slices.

UNet: baseline 2D U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015, "U-Net: Convolutional
Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation"). Used as the benchmark that the
CAN is compared against on the same splits.

CAN: 2D Context Aggregation Network (Yu and Koltun, 2016, "Multi-scale
context aggregation by dilated convolutions"). Instead of shrinking and
re-growing the image like a U-Net, it stays at full resolution and widens
its view with dilated 3x3 convolutions whose dilation doubles each layer.

ResidualCAN: CAN variant with hybrid (non-doubling) dilations and residual
context layers that start as identities, to reduce gridding on thin
structures such as the rectal wall.

Only PyTorch is used here (no NumPy), as required by the assessment spec.

    the receptive field (about 135 px) spans the prostate's surroundings in
